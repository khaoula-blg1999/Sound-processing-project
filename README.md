MFCC ( Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients ) is used to identify airline reservation, numbers spoken into a telephone and voice recognition system for security purpose.

DTW (dynamic time warping )  is a method to measure the similarity of a pattern with different time zones. The smaller the distance produced, the more similar between the two sound patterns. Both sound patterns are similar, thus the two voices are said to be the same.
